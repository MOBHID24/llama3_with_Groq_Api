            "The element that causes some people to sing well and others to sing badly are problems with pitch accuracy, also known as intonation. Pitch can be understood as the 'sharpness' of a voice; the higher the pitch, the sharper and shriller the voice sounds. Some people are born with certain innate abilities that melt our hearts or astonish us. Solution. I know this might sound a bit unconventional, but if you want to strengthen your core, pole dancing and Yoga are actually great exercises. Many singers have started doing them and have seen a huge improvement in their vocal power. Another important thing for singing is having strong lungs. The biggest reason we think we can't sing is our perception. When you hear that you have a terrible voice or fail an audition for the school choir, you perceive such experiences to be true. Then you clam up and swear you'll never sing again. You're giving away your power and right to sing. Look at the following list, then get busy and sing your favorite song. Singing will: Boost your immune system. Release stress. Benefit your heart. Increase your energy. Improve your memory. Foster clear thinking through correct breathing. I'll show you how this all works in a minute. \"All I've ever wanted to do is learn to sing,\" he said. \"I've been turned away by every voice teacher in town. They all said it's hopeless. I can't sing—because I'm tone deaf.\" At this point, I prayed I would somehow be able to help Rick. Music can be a healing agent. Singing can be therapy. He was in desperate need of both.\n",
